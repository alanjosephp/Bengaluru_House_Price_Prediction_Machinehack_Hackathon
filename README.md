Here’s a concise pointer summary of the project:

### **1. Problem Overview**
- **Goal**: Build a model to predict the price of houses in Bengaluru based on features such as location, size, amenities, and more.
- **Target Variable**: Price (in INR lakhs).

### **2. Data Features**
- **Categorical Features**: 
  - Area_type, Availability, Location, Society.
- **Continuous Features**: 
  - Size (BHK), Total_sqft, Bath, Balcony.
- **Target Variable**: 
  - Price.

### **3. Data Preprocessing**
- **Categorical Encoding**:
  - Use **Label Encoding** or **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables.
- **Missing Values**:
  - Handle missing data by imputing (mean/median) or dropping rows.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create new features like "Price per sqft."
- **Scaling**:
  - Scale continuous variables if necessary (e.g., Total_sqft, Bath, Balcony).

### **4. Model Selection**
- **Baseline Model**: 
  - Start with **Linear Regression** for simplicity.
- **Advanced Models**: 
  - **Random Forest**: Robust to overfitting, handles both categorical and numerical features.
  - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Great for structured data and typically performs well.
  - **Decision Trees**: Handle non-linear relationships.
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Can be effective but requires tuning.
  - **Neural Networks**: For complex patterns (if you have a large dataset).

### **5. Model Evaluation**
- **Metrics**:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average prediction error.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Focuses on large errors.
  - **R-squared (R²)**: Measures how well the model explains variance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure model generalizes well.

### **6. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use **Grid Search** to fine-tune model parameters.

### **7. Predictions**
- Predicitions of thbased on the tuned model.
